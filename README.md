# Click Confirm
Plays a client-side click sound when you equip items, drink a potion, eat food, pray, and more. Often times during a fight we are switching between menus fast to pray, eat, swap gear, and more... The server-side delay between the click and the sound of your action is often too long, and can be very punishing if you mis-click and do not realize. With this plugin you will instantly hear a sound when performing the action, giving you instant confirmation you did not mis-click.
